 ReactJS project with NASA APOD API
=======

A React + Vite project showing NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).  
Includes a fallback for non-image media (videos, etc.) with a badge linking to today's APOD.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
Create a .env file in the root:

ini
Copy code
VITE_NASA_API_KEY=YOUR_NASA_API_KEY
Get a free key at https://api.nasa.gov.

Run locally:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173.

Notes
If the APOD of the day is not an image, the portfolio shows a previous image. A badge informs the user and links to today's APOD on NASA's website.
